A TextMarker is a\n\t// handle that can be used to clear or find a marked position in the\n\t// document. Line objects hold arrays (markedSpans) containing\n\t// {from, to, marker} object pointing to such marker objects, and\n\t// indicating that such a marker is present on that line. Multiple\n\t// lines may point to the same marker when it spans across lines.\n\t// The spans will have null for their from/to properties when the\n\t// marker continues beyond the start/end of the line. Markers have\n\t// links back to the lines they currently touch.\n\t\n\t// Collapsed markers have unique ids, in order to be able to order\n\t// them, which is needed for uniquely determining an outer marker\n\t// when they overlap (they may nest, but not partially overlap).\n\tvar nextMarkerId = 0;\n\t\n\tvar TextMarker = function(doc, type) {\n\t  this.lines = [];\n\t  this.type = type;\n\t  this.doc = doc;\n\t  this.id = ++nextMarkerId;\n\t};\n\t\n\t// Clear the marker.\n\tTextMarker.prototype.clear = function () {\n\t    var this$1 = this;\n\t\n\t  if (this.explicitlyCleared) { return }\n\t  var cm = this.doc.cm, withOp = cm && !cm.curOp;\n\t  if (withOp) { startOperation(cm); }\n\t  if (hasHandler(this, \"clear\")) {\n\t    var found = this.find();\n\t    if (found) { signalLater(this, \"clear\", found.from, found.to); }\n\t  }\n\t  var min = null, max = null;\n\t  for (var i = 0; i < this.lines.length; ++i) {\n\t    var line = this$1.lines[i];\n\t    var span = getMarkedSpanFor(line.markedSpans, this$1);\n\t    if (cm && !this$1.collapsed) { regLineChange(cm, lineNo(line), \"text\"); }\n\t    else if (cm) {\n\t      if (span.to != null) { max = lineNo(line); }\n\t      if (span.from != null) { min = lineNo(line); }\n\t    }\n\t    line.markedSpans = removeMarkedSpan(line.markedSpans, span);\n\t    if (span.from == null && this$1.collapsed && !lineIsHidden(this$1.doc, line) && cm)\n\t      { updateLineHeight(line, textHeight(cm.display)); }\n\t  }\n\t  if (cm && this.collapsed && !cm.options.lineWrapping) { for (var i$1 = 0; i$1 < this.lines.length; ++i$1) {\n\t    var visual = visualLine(this$1.lines[i$1]), len = lineLength(visual);\n\t    if (len > cm.display.maxLineLength) {\n\t      cm.display.maxLine = visual;\n\t      cm.display.maxLineLength = len;\n\t      cm.display.maxLineChanged = true;\n\t    }\n\t  } }\n\t\n\t  if (min != null && cm && this.collapsed) { regChange(cm, min, max + 1); }\n\t  this.lines.length = 0;\n\t  this.explicitlyCleared = true;\n\t  if (this.atomic && this.doc.cantEdit) {\n\t    this.doc.cantEdit = false;\n\t    if (cm) { reCheckSelection(cm.doc); }\n\t  }\n\t  if (cm) { signalLater(cm, \"markerCleared\", cm, this, min, max); }\n\t  if (withOp) { endOperation(cm); }\n\t  if (this.parent) { this.parent.clear(); }\n\t};\n\t\n\t// Find the position of the marker in the document.

The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel\n * delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to immediately invoke them.\n * Provide `options` to indicate whether `func` should be invoked on the\n * leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout. The `func` is invoked\n * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent\n * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last `func`\n * invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function\n * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\n * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @since 0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]\n *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n * @param {number} [options.maxWait]\n *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n * @example\n *\n * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\n * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n *\n * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\n * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n *   'leading': true,\n *   'trailing': false\n * }));\n *\n * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\n * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\n * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\n *\n * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\n */\nfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n  var lastArgs,\n      lastThis,\n      maxWait,\n      result,\n      timerId,\n      lastCallTime,\n      lastInvokeTime = 0,\n      leading = false,\n      maxing = false,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n  }\n  wait = toNumber(wait) || 0;\n  if (isObject(options)) {\n    leading = !!options.leading;\n    maxing = 'maxWait' in options;\n    maxWait = maxing ?
